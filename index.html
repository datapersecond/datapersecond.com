      <h3>There is a rate at which data analysts and data scientists can process data -- their "data per second." Your "data per second" can be improved through the most appropirate tools, well-timed training, and  workflow adjustments customized to your situation.</h3>
      <h1>We are unconventional.</h1>
      <p><strong>We start with user research,</strong> where we talk to your data scientsits and analysts and understand the problems they're trying to solve, and what slows them down. <strong>We then solve their problems</strong></p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Perhaps you don't know what your problem is, but you know your team can do better.<strong>We write a report with recommendations on next steps to improve your team's success.</strong></p>

      <h2>Training</h2>
      <p>Perhaps your team's workflow just isn't smooth enough. Maybe you need to use Dat, Dask, and Ibis. <strong>We train your team in a new workflow, or refer you to trainers if we can't do the training ourselves.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>Perhaps your team is lacking on data quality and needs a new pipeline that verifies data. <strong>We use stable open source software and build a custom solution for you.</p>
